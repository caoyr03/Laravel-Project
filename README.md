## Project Overview

This project is a Laravel-based simple application. Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. 

- Create a table in a MySQL DB called â€œsermons" with 3 columns: id, title, and description. Use the data supplied by this [feed](https://stagingapi.elevationchurch.org/v2/wordpress/ec/getSermonsList).
- Create a LARAVEL API (using passport or JWT for authentication) application with an endpoint "/sermons/list". This API should read the records in the "sermons" table and return the data in JSON format.
- Create an ANOTHER LARAVEL application (not an api) that will list the sermon records in an HTML table (pagination would be great) consuming the endpoint "/sermons/list" from the API application created in step 2.
